## Implementations
-Bootstrap theme, have a grid shape of example images as the project listing in the jumbotron. Could have logos below as well (UPS, Candace Research when they've got a site going). I think what I have in mind would have a jumbotron layout but make use of the Album template for images. When the user hovers over the (hyperlinked to project) image the highlight box will reveal some more details about the project. The navbar can also have image links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. (could be below as well)
-Opening splash screen (index.html) can have "Welcome" dissolve into an interactive fluid sim
-Alternate: fade/switch to graph-theoretic model of the letters.
-Project showcase, about, contact info on the main page after that.
-The idea of the main page should be some "toy" examples of what I've done/am interested in.
-Some kind of crypto on the letters would be interesting
-Also have some kind of light source, where the mouse becomes an object of the scene and has shadows rendered in real time along with objects that the user can drag in (have a box of shapes of to the side that say Drag Me!)
-I would also like to work on a library at some point. The decision on what it will provide may have to wait as I become more mature in programming and more decided on what I'd like to focus on (I am most interested in writing a library for whatever I'm) actively working towards. (Maybe a simple C/js/x86... small, mathematical library for starters to get my feet wet. Perhaps helping Jesse with his cont'd fractions?)
