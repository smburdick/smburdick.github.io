    <p>I like to make cool things happen, like producing colorful images out of measly text files, and for that sort of thing they call me a software developer.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p1>Writing code may be hard, but at least when it starts to work, it's earned like it should be. Then anyone with an Internet connection can immediately benefit from it, which is by itself rewarding. Math is also pretty hard, but when you're done you just got some symbols that only a handful of people would ever bother to understand. But we wouldn't have killer special effects and other important things without linear algebra, so I've taken it upon myself to understand both. That's why I'm studying computer science and mathematics at the <a href="http://pugetsound.edu/">University of Puget Sound</a>. I also know a little Japanese, and I've <a href="img/meiji-brighter.jpg">travelled around Japan a bit</a>.</p1> (That's the entrance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine">Meiji Shrine</a> in Tokyo.)
